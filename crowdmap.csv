His projects have ranged from complex rail stations and busy public intersections to quiet interpretive buildings, meditation chambers and galleries. With a Masters Degree in Art from the University of Washington and a BA in Theatrical Design from San Diego State University, Corsonâ€™s work is infused with drama, passion, layered meanings and often engages the public as co-creators within his environments. He is particularly interested in green design and new technologies and how these tools can help frame and amplify the natural word and our shifting relationship to it. Among his various awards, Corson has been honoured with 8 coveted Public Art Network Year-in-Review National Awards, received the NW Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies (NIAUSI prize) fellowship in Italy, and was recognized by Seattle Homes and Lifestyle as one of the top people that define Seattle Design. He has partnered with architects and landscape architects for 4 AIA Awards and 3 ASLA Awards.About the Sculpture - The sculpturesâ€™ name, â€œNepenthes Paisleyi,â€ù is derived from a Greek magical potion that would cause the drinker to forget pain, grief, and sorrow. Dan hopes that these sculptures might provide a brief respite from a hectic daily life, transporting us briefly somewhere else. Nepenthes is also the name of a family of beautiful and unusual Carnivorous plants. These tropical pitcher plants, or ""monkey cups,"" collect water in their leaf vases that sometimes monkeys drink from. The water has an enzyme in them that helps dissolve insects (and sometimes small animals) that find their way into the cups providing fertilizer for the plants that normally live in infertile locations. The shapes of the sculptures are inspired by the shape of a Nepenthes. The shapes of the four sculptures are inspired by the shape of a variety of Nepenthes and celebrates the wonderful diversity and creativity of this colourful neighbourhood.","Public Art,Mainly Historical,Weird or Wacky,Trusted Reports",53.41364,-113.56232,Exterior,I know more and would like to talk about it,Permanent,Cody,Price,cody.price@brookfieldrp.com,YES,NO201,0,,,Nude sculpture,41912.73333,10332-124 St,Two metal sculptures in the front of Douglas Udell Art Gallery,"Public Art,Weird or Wacky,Mainly Historical,Trusted Reports",53.543897,-113.536054,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,Luba,Lubchenko,lubarom@yahoo.com,YES,NO199,1,,,Parking at the Mountain Equipment Co-op,41912.67361,"12328 â€“ 102nd Ave, Edmonton, MEC",Display for arts collective program (Yarn bombing project)at Robertson-Wesley United Church.,"Public Art,Mainly Historical,Weird or Wacky,Trusted Reports",53.543171,-113.535427,Exterior,I'd like to know more,Permanent,Luba,Lubchenko,lubarom@yahoo.com,YES,NO197,1,,,#openartyeg more cool ornaments in @churchillsquar...,41912.54514,Churchill Square,#openartyeg more cool ornaments in @churchillsquare http://t.co/UjBdVtJuCD,"Public Art,Trusted Reports",53.544178,-113.490049,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES195,1,,,Jasper Benches,41911.80139,Jasper,"I love the quotes, font and texture of these benches in #yegDT #openartyeg @ Jasper Avenue http://t.co/BEcgKkDMxZ",Public Art,53.541039,-113.506324,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES194,1,,,Hellenic Canadian community cultural centre memorial,41911.75625,Oliver,Hellenic Canadian community cultural centre memorial #openartyeg http://t.co/q1fOOCniIw,"Public Art,Weird or Wacky",53.548385,-113.521754,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES193,1,,,Magpie Stencil,41911.84583,South Edmonton,"""@jfranceska: @OpenEdmonton I don't think I've seen one - like this?

We have architect Peter Hemingway to thank for the original inspirationâ€” in the early â€˜70s he designed the now-demolished Central Pentecostal Tabernacle. Part of which was a large pyramid structure- a precursor to the Muttart Conservatory, which he created later in the decade. The Muttart Conservatory is a striking addition to our River Valley, and its four pyramids are mirrored in other elements of civic architecture like Gene Dubâ€™s City Hall design. In 2008, the Muttart Conservatory underwent a renovation, which included interior improvements and the addition of a bold front entryway. To mark the entrance, the City of Edmonton wished to have a black granite pyramid to be engraved with an artistâ€™s design placed at the entry to the new plaza. Vancouver artist Mia Weinberg was commissioned to design the four sides of the pyramid and chose to represent both natural and man-made images, which were sandblasted into the surface of the black granite. Two of the four sides reference the context of the Muttart Conservatory and are engraved with images of plants; one a microscopic view of an aspen leaf and the other a fern frond. The two remaining sides are city maps, the grid-like streets that surround West Edmonton Mall and the more curvy roads of the river valley bisected by the North Saskatchewan River. This juxtaposition points out similarities between the vascular system of plants and the macro-view of our streetscapesâ€” they are both â€œskeletonsâ€ù for the organism/city, shuttling nutrients/passengers to where they are needed. The imagery is appropriate, considering Edmonton is known for its extensive park system nestled within heavily urbanized areas.(Information generously provided by the Edmonton Arts Council.)",Public Art,53.535493,-113.477071,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES94,1,,,Futuristic Map by Patrick Jacob,41909.61806,"114 Street and 76 Avenue NW, Edmonton, AB","The new street-level LRT stations along 114 Street change the once-straightforward contours of the roadway. Sharing the road, there is also now a track, as well as the swells and curves of the islands of concrete and landscaping surrounding the stations. Patrick Jacobâ€™s installation along the pedestrian underpass of McKernan/Belgravia LRT station, Futuristic Map , takes those new topographies and abstracts them into Art Deco-style conceptualizations of transportation in the 21st century. The work is meant to represent â€œwhere we once were and where tomorrow will lead,â€ù as Jacob describes in his artist statement. Futuristic Map is a relief sculpture made of layered, laser-cut steel with stylized imagery of a map, as the title suggests. Art Deco is a particularly interesting inspiration point given that the movement coincided with the rise of modernism in the â€˜20s, favouring science, technology and geometry over traditional subjects such as landscape or portraiture. A movement that emphasized futurism over romance or sentimentalism, Art Deco lends some of its characteristic qualities to the material choice and production of this work. The components are made of steel and were constructed using high-tech manufacturing processes that result in bold lines and geometric shapes. The industrial feel of the artwork is no coincidence. Jacob worked as a machinist in the oil field for 14 years, and has been practicing as a self-taught artist since 2001.(Information generously provided by Edmonton Arts Council.)",Public Art,53.512907,-113.525934,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES93,1,,,The monument to Alberta's Broken Families,41909.94444,"Edmonton, 116 - 100 Ave","The monument to Alberta's Broken Families is made of stainless steel, granite and concrete.

Wells,41906.59931,"14994 23 Avenue, Edmonton, AB","Hamilton-based artist C. Wellsâ€™ recent practice has involved using line marker paintâ€” the medium used to draw the lines on roadâ€” in performance as well as on canvas. With LEGER/REGEL , his piece created for the Leger Transit Station, Wells has created an interesting composition, which juxtaposes natural and man-made elements. On the one hand there is an image of trees taken from an angle approximating a bus riderâ€™s view, and on the other hand white and yellow line marker paint has been meticulously added along the lower edge of the image. Despite the representation of trees as nature, the paint lines underscore the fact that we are in an urban environment. In addition, the images are mirrored horizontally and read like a palindrome. This visual cue is echoed in the title of the piece, LEGER/REGEL , and is evocative of the action of commuting in the form of a return trip. The neighborhood of Leger is named after a former Edmonton city alderman, Edmund Hugh Leger, who served in the late â€˜50s and early â€˜60s. And â€œregelâ€ù happens to be a German word, which roughly translates in English to mean â€œas a rule, generally or under normal circumstance.â€ù â€œRegelâ€ù would apply to activities like a daily commute, or taking transit on oneâ€™s daily errands like shopping or traveling to appointments. It also applies to the ubiquity of the Alberta sky, and the sight of native trees while looking out of the window of a bus, as well as the universally understood meaning of marker paint on a road. Wellsâ€™ past work has been on canvas, as performances on site, or as poetic nonfiction that combines theory, history, and personal experience of his work with line markings. LEGER/REGEL is true to Wellsâ€™ practice as it is a reworking of the familiar (trees and traffic lines) in an unfamiliar fashion, creating the effect of recognition and re-cognition of the presented image. Like the title, the image is a palindromeâ€” it takes only a moment to register the joke, but given time to understand, the meaning becomes richer.Provided by: Edmonton Arts Council",Public Art,53.455279,-113.577955,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES41,1,,,Past and Present by Kryzstof Zukowski,41906.59861,"7000 143 Street, Edmonton, AB","Five tall steel masts topped with propellers set in orange circular bases.Provided by: Edmonton Arts Council",Public Art,53.503475,-113.571365,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES40,1,,,fire_scape by Jorn Ebner,41906.59653,"9020 111 Avenue, Edmonton, AB","The work 'fire_scape' is a 4-panel wall installation, each staggered 5cm from the next.

The three forms are suspended at the entrances of the Century Park LRT station, contrasting the modernist lines of glass and aluminum with Continuumâ€™s roundness and playful evocation of nature. The artists both have a background in industrial and interior design, as evident in Continuumâ€™s structure and architectural detail. Continuum consists of three wire spheres, covered with hundreds of maple leaf forms of water-jet cut aluminum. The leaves are spaced so that light can be seen through the sphere. It is an airy bubble of near-nature, visible from most angles by the many commuters who move throughout the building. The pieces work with the transparency of the glass and apparent lightness of the spheres, which are powder-coated red, yellow, blue and green to bring a sense of seasonality and heighten our connection to natureâ€” the template of leaf itself is taken from a fallen leaf collected by the artists from a tree on the University of Alberta campus, which they scanned and traced, and then scaled up to various sizes.

Artist Keith Walker chose to work with bright colours and exaggerated dimensions knowing that the glass sculptures would be installed near windows, high above. About 500 separate pieces of glass were created to form the eight clusters, which are suspended from the ceiling of a gathering space in the Central Lions Senior Recreation Centre. This process took nearly a year to complete with a production style akin to that of the traditional glass artisans in Italy and Poland. Historically, glass making was a highly prized skill and techniques were often kept secret with methods passed down from master to apprentice. There is an elusive quality to glass that has enchanted people for generations. The materiality of glass is extremely technical, something that Walker feels one never fully masters. This piece is a demonstration of the beauty and versatility of the medium, used in an imaginative way. Walker intends this piece to generate discussion on the art of glass making. Edmonton-based glass blower Keith Walker likens his craft to a sport requiring drills and exercises before the final execution of the piece. It requires teamwork, a gamblerâ€™s sense of risk-taking, and some improvisation as the glass evolves during its creation. Many steps are required before the project is completed, and a team of players (assistants, welders, installers) works together to coordinate such a large-scale project. In terms of the material, working with glass is a physically demanding process, yet must be handled with extreme delicacy.Provided by: Edmonton Arts Council",Public Art,53.559252,-113.515859,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES24,1,,,Overflow by Brendan McGillicuddy,41904.60833,"17740 69 Avenue, Edmonton, AB","Overflow is an elaborate relief sculpture composed of layers of frosted polycarbonate, cut into hundreds of icicle-like outcroppings.

In the case of Bioglyphs by Ron Baird, the intersection between art and science has created a work that is very meaningful to the place where it has been installed: the Biotechnology Business Development Centre. The BBDC is a research park with laboratory space and offices for companies conducting scientific research in medicine, biotechnology, electronics, telecommunications, software, petroleum research and cold-climate engineering. Artist Ron Baird drew inspiration from the world of scienceâ€” biology, medicine, environmental and agri-food scienceâ€”when composing the imagery for the artwork. Bioglyphs is a metal column with laser-cut symbols from ancient mythology and science. Baird calls his work â€œa wall of historic graffiti,â€ù using both contemporary and ancient symbols from around the world. The central image, sandblasted into stainless steel, is adapted from an Assyrian painting depicting the Water God surrounded by water molecules. The other images are cut out of the metal and include stylized symbols of a cell membrane G protein (the target of many pharmacological studies), and the Egyptian hieroglyph for fruit fly- a significant research subject for those working in the field of genetics. Baird worked with medical researcher and CEO of DecisionLine Clinical Research Corporation, Dr. Edward M. Sellers, who provided the background knowledge on specific scientific concepts, formulae, and symbols. The resulting work draws the link between mythological concepts and scientific realityâ€” and the places where they are one and the same.Provided by: Edmonton Arts Council",Public Art,53.498167,-113.481657,Exterior,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES22,1,,,The Farm Family by Rob McInnis,41904.6,"13550 163 Street, Edmonton, AB","With his project for the newly constructed Animal Services Building, photographer Rob MacInnis has taken a traditional form of art and given it a new perspective. The piece, entitled The Farm Family , depicts dozens of farm animalsâ€” cattle, horses, sheep, hogs, goats, and dogs, all from farms that the artist visited on Prince Edward Islandâ€” lined up in front of farm buildings, as if posing for a traditional formal portrait. The completed work is very large, spanning a length of nine metres and a height reaching over a metre tall. Of course, in reality, the animals would not be so cooperative as to stand and pose for the camera all at once, so each animal was individually photographed and digitally collaged into one image. The Farm Family is part of a larger series of work, featuring individual animal portraiture and group portraits. The style of the photographs are meant to evoke contemporary fashion spreads, such as those by Annie Leibowitz and David LaChapelle. And, like fashion photography, the models are at once elevated to be ideal images of beauty, while they are also debased as objects. The intent of the artist is to have us question the role that animals play in our society: can we imagine them not as workers or food, but as individuals equal to ourselves? Portraiture is inherently about showing the personality of the subjectâ€”are we willing to grant animals the same self-expression? What does it mean to capture them in this way? As artwork in the Animal Care & Control Centre, where stray animals are housed and treated, The Farm Family will be a reminder of how important animals are in our lives, and how each animal is worthy of respect.Provided by: Edmonton Arts Council",Public Art,53.59842,-113.602666,Interior Not Accessible after standard business hours,I don't know anything about it,Permanent,,,,YES,YES21,1,,,EcoStation by Brandon Blommaert,41904.59792,"14710 Ellerslie Road, edmonton, ab","Edmonton-born artist Brandon Blommaert created images for the new Ambleside Eco Station that feature Albertaâ€™s beautifully diverse landscapes, which act as cinematic backdrops for Blommaertâ€™s own particular brand of recycling. His work is a reflection of his personal interest and experience with post-consumer waste, and it allows us to re-imagine what it means to be a consumer, a recycler, and an Albertan lucky enough to live in a province so rich in natural beauty. Blommaert himself has worked in a paper sorting plant, which gives him an interesting and personal perspective on the process of recycling. It was the stacks of paper and cardboard that inspired his thinking about the waste we produce and the imagination it takes to recycle and reuse. Blommaert also has a background in animation, which lends an aspect of film or a stop-action model to the photographs he has created. The work itself consists of five images of typical Alberta landscapes: the Rocky Mountains, boreal forest, parkland, the Badlands and urban sprawl. The backgrounds are photographs, printed on large pieces of vinyl that cover significant sections of the exterior walls of the building. In these landscapes, Blommaert has digitally inserted monster-like creatures made from post-consumer waste. The artist collected trash he found on the street to create these sculptures, which is itself an ingenious way to recycle. Blommaertâ€™s creatures invite curiosity in these familiar settings.
